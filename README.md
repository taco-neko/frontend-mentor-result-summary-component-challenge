## Overview

This was a bit of a challenging project, I had trouble keeping things organised. I think I'm going to switch to Sass for future projects because nesting would've especially helped in keeping things readable.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

This took me way longer to do than it should have. I got frustrated with it a lot, because I couldn't figure out how to do seemingly simple things. I got it in the end though, and I'm pretty proud of it.

Side note: I'm really upset that transitions don't work on gradients. I wanted to put a nice transition on the button for the hover/focus states, but it just wouldn't work. After some googling, I found out it's just not a thing you can do without unnecessarily complicating things. Kinda upsetting.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- A lot of frustration

### What I learned

I learnt a lot more about how to use CSS grid and flexbox effectively, and also about how to do media queries right. I'm still not sure on how I should set up my breakpoints... I'm just kinda going along and seeing what looks decent.

Oh, and I used the min() function correctly. That was cool. 

### Continued development

I'm going to start learning Sass, at the very least for the nesting. I'm pretty comfortable with writing vanilla CSS but it gets out of hand quick.
